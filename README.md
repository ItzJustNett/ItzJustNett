Yo, I'm ItzJustNett! 😺🏐
Hey there! I'm a Cat Dev — coding with the grace of a feline and the energy of a volleyball spike. I whip up cool projects and spend my free time smashing serves on the court.
🐾 About Me

🧑‍💻 What I do: Code like a cat — quick, curious, and probably knocking over a few things.
🏐 My passion: Volleyball! Catch me diving for the ball or perfecting my jump serve.
😸 Fun fact: I probably have a fluffy white kitten watching me code (or stealing my chair).

🛠️ My Vibe

Crafting code that’s as clean as a cat’s leap.
Always up for a volleyball game or a coding jam session.
Check out my repos for some purr-fect projects!
